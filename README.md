# Matrix IRCd

## Deprecation

This project has been in a very hard to maintain state for a long time.
A clean rewrite will be easier, so matrix-ircd will not receive further updates.
See [matrix2051](https://github.com/progval/matrix2051) or [matrirc](https://github.com/martinetd/matrirc) for alternatives.

## General

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matrix-org/matrix-ircd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matrix-org/matrix-ircd)

An IRCd implementation backed by Matrix. Inspired by [PTO](https://github.com/tdfischer/pto)!

Join the discussion on the Matrix channel: [#matrix-ircd:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-ircd:matrix.org)

This is project is almost the inverse of matrix-appservice-irc. **matrix-ircd** lets you use any standard IRC Client to communicate with Matrix, whereas **matrix-appservice-irc** is primarily a way to use a Matrix client to communicate with IRC.

## Status

**This is a work in progress.** Matrix IRCd should be stable enough to hack on
and test, but has not been tested in production or for any length of time.

See the GitHub issues page for a more detailed breakdown of what is left to do.


## Building

Matrix IRCd requires Rust v1.31.0 or later.
Building and installing uses the standard `cargo` commands.

To run a plain debug version:

```
cargo run -- --url "https://matrix.org"
```

To build with trace logging:

```
cargo build --features trace_logging
```


## Usage

```
IRC Matrix Daemon 0.1.0

USAGE:
    matrix-ircd [OPTIONS] --url <MATRIX_HS>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --bind <BIND>            Sets the address to bind to. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:5999
        --url <MATRIX_HS>        The base url of the Matrix HS
        --password <PASSWORD>    The password of the PKCS#12 file
        --pkcs12 <PKCS12>        Sets the PKCS#12 file to read TLS cert and pkeyfrom

```

The `MATRIX_HS` URL should be of the form: `https://matrix.org`. Plain HTTP is
also supported but should *only* be used for testing and development.

Supplying both `pkcs12` and `password` arguments will cause Matrix IRCd to listen
on TLS, otherwise it will use plain TCP.

The credentials for the matrix account are taken from the user name and server
password specified by the IRC connection.

## Snap

This software includes packaging information for [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io).
Building the snap package is as simple as installing as running `snapcraft` in the
top-level directory of this repository. The resulting snap, until the snap is published
on `snapcraft.io`, can be installed locally by using the `--dangerous` option to
`snap install`. `--dangerous` is only needed as local snaps are not cryptographically
signed.

The `matrix-ircd` daemon is configured in the snap package to read an environment file,
which allows customisation of the parameters documented in the usage section. The
environment file is a bash script which sets several environment variable, which are
loaded by the systemd service file which runs `matrix-ircd` inside the snap environment.

To configure the service, create a file in `/var/snap/matrix-ircd/common` named
`matrix-ircd.env`, and set the following variables inside:

`MATRIX_IRCD_HOMESERVER`
Maps to the `--url` parameter, points to the home server you wold like `matrix-ircd` to
connect to.
Example: `MATRIX_IRCD_HOMESERVER=https://example.homeserver:8989`

`MATRIX_IRCD_BIND`
Maps to the `--bind` parameter, sets the IP and port you would like `matrix-ircd` to listen
on for IRC connections.
Example: `MATRIX_IRCD_BIND=0.0.0.0:9001`

If you would like to use TLS, both of the following settings will need to be set.
If you would not like to use TLS, do not include these settings in your environment file.

`MATRIX_IRCD_PASSWORD`
Sets the password used to access the PKCS#12 certificate bundle.
Example: `MATRIX_IRCD_PASSWORD=Passw0rd`

`MATRIX_IRCD_PKCS12`
Sets the filename of the PKCS#12 certificate bundle. This file must be located in the
`/var/snap/matrix-ircd/common` directory.
Example: `matrix-ircd.pfx`

With all of these parameters set, you should be able to start the service with:
`systemctl start snap.matrix-ircd.matrix-ircd`
Any errors with your configuration will be record in the system's `journald` logs
for the service.

## Development

Matrix IRCd aims to build with zero standard warning and no clippy warnings.

To run clippy use (after install clippy):

```
cargo clippy --features clippy
```

The feature flag disables certain spurious warnings related to third party
crates.


Some high level development documentation can be generated by:

```
cargo doc --open
```

To generate the full documentation, including private APIs, use:

```
cargo rustdoc -- --no-defaults --passes "collapse-docs" --passes "unindent-comments" --open
```
